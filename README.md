🗺️ Safari Parkour Adventure: The Noodle Gauntlet 🧭
Welcome to the README for our unique 3D Parkour Game Scene, where the thrill of speedrunning meets the whimsical world of spaghetti noodles! This scene is designed to showcase dynamic 3D environments, automated camera tracking, and a touch of playful chaos.
🌟 About the Game Scene
Embark on an extraordinary journey through a vibrant parkour course, suspended high above a sprawling landscape of falling spaghetti noodles! This scene combines challenging platforming elements with an unexpected, gravity-defying twist, all set against a backdrop of colorful panels.
✨ Features
Looped Parkour Course: Navigate a continuous path designed for endless speedrunning attempts, looping seamlessly back to the start.
Dynamic Panels: The course is constructed from eye-catching pink, green, and yellow panels, creating a visually distinct and engaging environment.
Inverted Movement Sections: Experience exhilarating moments as the course curves, allowing the "pawn" to move along inverted surfaces, challenging conventional gravity.
Difficulty Markers: Wall panels strategically placed throughout the course display point values (10, 20, 30 Pts), indicating increasing levels of difficulty for aspiring speedrunners.
Spaghetti Noodle Deluge: Witness hundreds of shorter spaghetti noodles, each with a mass of 0.25, falling and settling on the ground far below the elevated course, adding a surreal and fun atmosphere.
Automated Pawn & Camera: A small blue pawn automatically traverses the course, with the camera dynamically following its every move, providing a cinematic tour of the action.
Integrated Ad Spaces: Designated light grey panels are seamlessly integrated into the environment, offering prime locations for future in-game advertisements without disrupting gameplay.
